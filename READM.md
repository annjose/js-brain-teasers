This is the collection of puzzles in the book **Javascript Brain Teasers** by **Faraz K Kelhini**. I got this book from the Cambrian Park library in Dec 2025.

The book's goal is to teach the nuances of Javascript through these puzzles - guessing what the output would be, seeing the results and learning why the output was that.
